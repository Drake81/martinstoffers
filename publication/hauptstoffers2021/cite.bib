    abstract = {Consultation services are an helpful tool to support scientists in developing software. Different types of knowledge are required to perform an efficient and effective consultation. Based on our experience, by providing a consultation service for 18 research centers with over 43,000 employees, we defined five roles and show their relevance on three consultations. Being aware of these roles and trying to cover them when setting up a consultancy, is an important step towards a good consultancy.},
