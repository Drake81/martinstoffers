BACARDI ist Teil eines Vorhabens des Deutschen Zentrums für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (DLR) zur Erfassung und Nachverfolgung von kooperativen und unkooperativen Objekten im Erdorbit. Aufbauend auf Open Source Software entsteht mit BACARDI ein System für den Einsatz im Deutschen Raumfahrkontrollzentrum, das Informationen über alle bekannten orbitalen Objekte verwaltet und aufbereitet. Im Vortrag werden wir zunächst erläutern, warum Raumfahrtrückstände überhaupt problematisch sind und welche Gefahren für aktive Objekte und Menschen im Erdorbit entstehen. Daran anschließend werden wir darlegen, warum wir in der Entwicklung Open Source Software und Bibliotheken einsetzen und weshalb wir uns für Django und Apache Airflow als Kernkomponenten entschieden haben. Als Schwerpunkt stellen wir die Eigenentwicklung F2x vor. Diese Open Source Software dient der Anbindung von Fortran-Software an das BACARDI- System. Im Rahmen des Vortrags erläutern wir, welche Vorteile diese Software für unseren Einsatzzweck gegenüber anderen Lösungen bietet und welche Vorteile sie für andere Projekte bieten kann. Auf der BACARDI Datenbank setzen Prozesse auf, die die dort hinterlegten Orbitinformationen verarbeiten um zum Beispiel Kollisionswarnungen zu generieren. Als Betreiber von Satelliten ist das DLR direkt von Gefahren wie Kollisionen betroffen. Es forscht deshalb aktiv auf diesem Gebiet und entwickelt zur Unterstützung der Raumflugbetriebe unter anderem Modelle und Software zur Berechnung orbitaler Flugdynamik.","tags":[],"title":"Open Source im BACARDI Projekt","type":"event"},{"authors":["Martin Stoffers","Michael Meinel","Martin Weigel","Martin Siggel","Hauke Fiedler","Kathrin Rack","Yi Wasser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1549929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549929600,"objectID":"50ddfd1bd4f1985880d3d6376387c4fe","permalink":"https://martinstoffers.de/publication/stoffersmeinelweigel2019/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stoffersmeinelweigel2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the Backend Catalogue for Relational Debris Information (BACARDI) as an effort of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to keep track of cooperative and uncooperative Earth orbiting objects.

Since today's process operations in distributed systems are fairly complex, recording all actions is critical in order to ensure reliability and constitute trust in the systems. One example application, developed by the department of Intelligent and Distributed Systems in collaboration with the German Space Operations Center (GSOC), is the Backend Catalog for Relational Debris Information (BACARDI). Its purpose is to collect and store information about more than ten million objects in orbit around earth, measured by various sensor networks. Before storing the data additional calculations like size, velocity, orbit, and collision detection with other objects, are performed on each object in a distributed manner. Collecting provenance about involved steps and actors is vital to prove the reliability of the events, especially to detect possible collisions. On the one hand it is about collecting provenance, on the other hand it is about protecting provenance from unintended or intended changes, since only unchanged data can be utilized for trustworthy predictions and safe inference in BACARDI or similar systems. After Nakamoto proposed the blockchain technology in his paper, new types of tamper resistant and distributed data storage techniques have evolved from it. These technologies can be applied to vital provenance data to protect it from possible alternation, even in distributed systems. Therefore, the main subject of this thesis is to elaborate and survey concepts for storing provenance data in blockchain-like databases. These concepts are analysed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages, tamper-resistance, and possible use cases, followed by a proof-of-concept implementation of all concepts in one particular blockchain-like database. Subsequently, performance measurements are conducted on each implementation followed by an analysis with respect to the concept design.","tags":["provenance"],"title":"Trustworthy Provenance Recording using a blockchain-like database","type":"publication"}]
