Examples are applied guidelines at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) or the NL eScience Center. Recently, these guidelines were acknowledged as important by the European Union, the Helmholtz Association, and the Max-Planck Society as well as in their strive to support Open Science. But, most guidelines lack information on how to apply Secure Software Engineering (SSE) methods in Scientific Software. More importantly, it is not even clear what aspects of SSE are of particular interest in Research Software Development. In 2018, we published a position and vision paper at the \"1st International Workshop on Security Awareness from Design to Deployment\" called \"DLR Secure Software Engineering\". In this paper we drew an ambitious roadmap towards a structured approach for identification and evaluation of relevant aspects and processes. Since then, we gained some insights about what is already possible, what could be done, and what is (yet) beyond our reach. In this talk we want to discuss and raise awareness why Secure Software Engineering is an important factor that needs to be acknowledged in the Research Software Engineering Community. We also want to have a look at certain aspects of our previous work and also evaluate on how things could be done (different).","tags":["RSE"],"title":"Revisiting Secure Software Engineering for Research Software","type":"event"},{"authors":["Martin Stoffers","Michael Meinel","Benjamin Hofmann","Andreas Schreiber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"8aba68b800262f62bd9a2801638321ea","permalink":"https://martinstoffers.de/publication/stoffersmeinelhofman2022/","publishdate":"2022-08-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stoffersmeinelhofman2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessments about the quality, reliability, and trust-worthiness of data used and generated in mission critical soft-ware systems are important.

For Open Source projects and Inner Source projects, the team composition and development process is transparent and traceable and can be evaluated at any point of time by, for example, continuous evaluation with regard to security by automated analysis. Software development is a highly complex process involving a wide range of responsibilities and people. In addition, the complexity of the software itself grows over time. To cope with this different tools are used to support the development process. During the entire software development process, all these support tools produce several types of data. These large amounts of data, which are generated before, during, and after the development of a software, can be analyzed using Provenance. Provenance analysis focusing on the development of software projects provides insight into the interactions of people. These interactions can fall into different categories. To analyze the development process, we extract retrospective provenance from repositories and store it in a graph database for further analysis For conducting a security analysis of software and its development process, we integrate the extracted provenance information with bugs or vulnerabilities as reported by static analysis tools. We therefore consider individual commit snapshots in the history of the software repositories. According to the respective repository, we run certain static analysis tools on a snapshot, track their reported findings and save them into a database for later analysis. Interlinking the tools findings with provenance information is done via the respective snapshot's code commit operations. Using the combined information then allows various questions for researching on the development process and how security has been addressed.","tags":["RSE"],"title":"Automated, Provenance-Driven Security Audit for git-Based Repositories","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lynn von Kurnatowski","Martin Stoffers","Martin Weigel","Michael Meinel","Yi Wasser","Kathrin Rack","Hauke Fiedler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597968000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597968000,"objectID":"21bf64ea2ef412b29a835963ab7f58e5","permalink":"https://martinstoffers.de/publication/kurnatowskistofferweigeletal2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kurnatowskistofferweigeletal2020/","section":"publication","summary":"For Space Situational Awareness, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) develops the software system \"Backbone Catalogue of Relational Debris Information\" (BACARDI), which allows for keeping track of resident space objects.

Since today's process operations in distributed systems are fairly complex, recording all actions is critical in order to ensure reliability and constitute trust in the systems. One example application, developed by the department of Intelligent and Distributed Systems in collaboration with the German Space Operations Center (GSOC), is the Backend Catalog for Relational Debris Information (BACARDI). Its purpose is to collect and store information about more than ten million objects in orbit around earth, measured by various sensor networks. Before storing the data additional calculations like size, velocity, orbit, and collision detection with other objects, are performed on each object in a distributed manner. Collecting provenance about involved steps and actors is vital to prove the reliability of the events, especially to detect possible collisions. On the one hand it is about collecting provenance, on the other hand it is about protecting provenance from unintended or intended changes, since only unchanged data can be utilized for trustworthy predictions and safe inference in BACARDI or similar systems. After Nakamoto proposed the blockchain technology in his paper, new types of tamper resistant and distributed data storage techniques have evolved from it. These technologies can be applied to vital provenance data to protect it from possible alternation, even in distributed systems. Therefore, the main subject of this thesis is to elaborate and survey concepts for storing provenance data in blockchain-like databases. These concepts are analysed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages, tamper-resistance, and possible use cases, followed by a proof-of-concept implementation of all concepts in one particular blockchain-like database. Subsequently, performance measurements are conducted on each implementation followed by an analysis with respect to the concept design.","tags":["provenance"],"title":"Trustworthy Provenance Recording using a blockchain-like database","type":"publication"}]
